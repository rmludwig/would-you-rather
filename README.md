Design Decisions
1. in the rubric is says "Once the user logs in, the home page is shown", and that is tru on initial login to home page. However if the user goes to a direct URL like /leaderboard, then after they login the leaderboard will be displayed (rather than routing them to home when they were trying to get to leaderboard).
